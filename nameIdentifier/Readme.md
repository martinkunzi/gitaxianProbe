This part will use a calibrated magic card image as an entry, and return the name of the card as a return value

the card name zone is situated on the upper left corner. 

The program might not be able to scan silver bordered cards' names, as they might have strangely shaped names, and won't be part of our main project. 

If the image to text implementation goes smoothly, it could be an amelioration of the project
